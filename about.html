    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Kyle. I’ve been playing piano since I was 6 years old, and teaching for over 10 years. I also work as a music producer and mixing engineer, so I bring real-world creativity and technical skill into every lesson.</p>

    <p>I believe music education goes beyond reading notes — it builds confidence, creativity, and flexible thinking. Whether your goal is classical mastery, songwriting, or just a fun creative outlet, I tailor each lesson to your goals and pace.</p>

    <h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Every student learns differently — that’s why I only offer private, 1-on-1 instruction. I focus on understanding your strengths, challenges, and interests to build a personalized lesson plan that works for you.</p>

    <h3>My Method</h3>
    <p>I teach primarily using the Alfred Lesson and Recital series and supplement with custom arrangements, improvisation exercises, and creative challenges. My tech-savvy setup lets me offer engaging and interactive online lessons using PDFs, whiteboards, dual cameras, and studio audio.</p>
