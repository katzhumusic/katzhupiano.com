    <h2>Why Online Lessons Work</h2>
      <p>Online learning isn’t just convenient — it’s effective. No more commutes or waiting rooms. Just log in, and let’s make music.</p>

      <p>I’ve been teaching online since before it was cool (thanks, 2020), and my students thrive in this format. I use high-quality cameras, microphones, dual-piano setup, and live annotation tools to make lessons interactive and productive.</p>

      <p>Parents love the flexibility. Students love the comfort. And I love being able to teach from anywhere, anytime.</p>
